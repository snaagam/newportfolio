      excerpt: "Exploring the latest trends in data analytics, from AI-powered insights to real-time processing and predictive modeling that will shape the industry.",
      content: `
        <p>The data analytics landscape is evolving rapidly, with several key trends emerging that will define how we handle and interpret data in 2025 and beyond.</p>
        
        <h3>AI-Powered Analytics</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how we approach data analysis. Machine learning algorithms can now identify patterns and insights that would take human analysts weeks to discover.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-Time Processing</h3>
        <p>The demand for real-time insights is growing exponentially. Organizations need to make decisions based on current data, not historical reports.</p>
        
        <h3>Predictive Modeling</h3>
        <p>Advanced predictive models are becoming more accessible, allowing businesses to forecast trends and make proactive decisions rather than reactive ones.</p>
